ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning

In the new moment when technologies continue to make upgrades, I finally decided to learn something about language and coding. I want to learn more and more every day, because for sure technology will change the world, as it already changes many things that we already do.

Right now I'm studying web development basics, but always open to other languages that sweeten my curiosity. :brain:

## What I'm focusing on right now :building_construction::books:

Currently improving and learning more.... Foundations course at The Odin Project.
