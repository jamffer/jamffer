ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning

In the new moment when technologies continue to make upgrades, I finally decided to learn something about language and coding. I want to learn more and more every day, because for sure technology will change the world, as it already changes many things that we already do.

Right now I am studying python and javascript, but always open to other types of language that sweeten my curiosity. :brain:

## What I'm focusing on right now :building_construction::books:

Currently improving my Python and JavaScript skills to build api for websites: React, Next.js, Django...
